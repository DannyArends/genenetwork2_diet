* Introduction

Large system deployments tend to get very complex. In this document we
explain the GeneNetwork deployment system which is based on GNU Guix
(see Pjotr's [[https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/README.md][Guix-notes]]).

* Binary deployment

NYA (will go to README)

* From source deployment

GNU Guix allows for [[https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/REPRODUCIBLE.org][reproducible deployment]] based on a checked out
Guix repository - use gn-stable for that:

#+begin_src sh   :lang bash
mkdir genenetwork
cd genenetwork
git checkout https://github.com/genenetwork/guix.git gn-stable-guix
git checkout https://github.com/genenetwork/guix-bioinformatics.git
#+end_src

Next build guix (and run) following the instructions in [[https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/INSTALL.org#building-gnu-guix-from-source-using-guix][guix-notes]].

Once that is done we can add the guix-bioinformatics path with

: env GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=../guix-bioinformatics ./pre-inst-env guix package -A slurm
