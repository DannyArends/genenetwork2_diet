* Introduction

Large system deployments tend to get very complex. In this document we
explain the GeneNetwork deployment system which is based on GNU Guix
(see Pjotr's [[https://github.com/pjotrp/guix-notes/blob/master/README.md][Guix-notes]]).

* Binary deployment (WIP)

GN can be deployed either as a binary tarball or as a GNU Guix
package.

* Source deployment and other information on reproducibility

See the document [[GUIX-Reproducible-from-source.org]].
